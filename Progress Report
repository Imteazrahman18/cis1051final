Project Title: Get Vaccinated! 


For the project I have completed around 60 percent so far and hope to finish the rest by this weekend. I have gathered the main figures, characters, and illustrations for my 
interactive game. This includes the background/environment, the characters which are apart of the game, and other necessary components. I am well into the coding part, but I still more to complete 
in terms of getting all the elements to interact with one another as apart of a system. 


I have still not completed the deeper part of the game where all the components come together. Essenestially it still isn't a fully pledged working game yet but will be in the upcoming days.
I have to make the coding programs for Covid-19 Viruses, which in the game, spit/shoot out virus particles which the main figure(Covid Vaccine Vial) has to in return attack back or 
refrain from getting hit by those virus particles( which is the main essence of the game). 

I have still deciding on how to add a twist or spin to the game to make it a little different from the original concept. I am having a little trouble but I am doing more research and hoepfully I will
figure out something by this weekend. All in all I am confident I can have a finised product by the deadline Monday.
